# Python DSA Practices 🐍📚

A personal repository for learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python from scratch.

This project is part of my journey to deeply understand DSA concepts — with implementations, theory breakdowns, and examples — while following a Udemy course and other resources.
